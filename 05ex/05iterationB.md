## Definite loops

    - quite often we have a list of items of the lines in a file - effectively a finite set of things.
    - we can write a loop to run the loop once for each of the items in a set of using the python for construct. 
    - these loops are called 'definite loops' because they execute an exact number of times.
    - we say that 'defnite loops iterate through the members of a set'
        #sample - simple definite loop
            for i in [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] : #i is going to be 5, then 4, ...
                print(i)
            print('blastoff')
